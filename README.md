# Reddit-Image-Scraping

Scraping images from one of my favourite subreddit [r/Fairytail_Hentai](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fairytail_hentai/) using selenium and beautifulsoup4.

## Requirements
* selenium
```
> pip install selenium
```
* Chrome webdriver [ [download-link](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) ]
* beautifulsoup4
```
> pip install beautifulsoup4
```
* python version above 3.6

## Working
In this project/code I've used this specific [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fairytail_hentai/), but this code can be used on any other subreddit similarly. __no login required__. 

This script scrapes the dynamically generated website for a specified period of time (default: 10 mins). To change the duration change the ```end_time``` variable in seconds.
